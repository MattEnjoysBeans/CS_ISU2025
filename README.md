Tabla-Search

Description:
Tabla-Search is a filtering search engine that allows the user to access specific results based on their preferences. The goal of this is to reduce the need to make multiple searches to find what you want or have already found, and instead offer it to you within a few clicks.

Features:
- Login/Register with a Remember Me option for instant login to reduce time in future instances
- Save links to query against in the Preferences tab
- Preferences are compatable with Youtube Channel links and can query with those in mind
- Search for tablature in reference to all of your preferred websites
- Save your favourite tablature for ease of access in the Saved tab

How to Use:
1. Create an account
2. Login (Check off 'Remember Me' to stay logged in)
3. Add preferences, you can leave it blank, however only the most matching result will come up when searching for tablature. Make sure it is in link format, otherwise your preference will not work.
4. Search for your desired tablature by entering the name on the Home page. You do not need to add anything extra other than the name of the song, the app will do the rest.
5. Save a result for later by clicking the 'Save' button and access those results by clicking into the Saved tab.
6. Log out to end session if you do not desire to come back or stay logged in after clicking 'Remember Me'
7. Send an email to mattias.romano47@gmail.com to request with your username for your account to be deleted. Expect a response in 3-5 business days.
